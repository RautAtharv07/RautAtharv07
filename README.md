### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm Atharv Raut, a curious and driven student currently pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I have a deep interest in backend development, open source contribution, and the applications of AI and machine learning in solving real-world problems. I love building scalable web services with Python frameworks like Django and FastAPI, and I'm constantly exploring new tools and technologies that push the boundaries of what's possible.

My focus lies in clean architecture, REST API design, and working with databases. Recently, I've also been diving into advanced AI concepts like LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. I'm always looking to collaborate on innovative projects, contribute to open source, and keep leveling up as a developer.
